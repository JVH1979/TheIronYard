<p><center>The craft beverage industry has a deep, rich history in the carolinas.  From the moonshiners of the mountains, to the "distributors" of the midlands who accidentally created nascar, to the coastal regions that still produce the elements that make quality product. This industry has thrived and the renewed interest has given the fuel to drive this hobby into a more thriving and diverse industry than it already has been.<center></p>
